You will be given a resume file and a job description. Your task is to write a cover letter based on the resume and job description. The cover letter should be tailored to the job description and highlight the candidate’s skills and experience.

Follow this structure (Don't actually add in "Opening" "Why I'm...." as titles, dont be stupid, be professional):

Opening: Start with a strong hook that captures the reader’s attention and introduces the candidate’s enthusiasm for the role and company. Consider using a personal anecdote or a specific achievement that relates to the role.
Why I’m the Perfect Candidate: Highlight the candidate’s key skills and experiences that align with the job requirements. Use quantifiable achievements to demonstrate impact.
Why This Role is Perfect for Me: Explain why the role aligns with the candidate’s career goals and interests.
Why I’m the Perfect Candidate for This Role: Provide specific examples of how the candidate’s skills and experiences make them a great fit for the role.
Company Interest: Discuss what the company is doing that excites the candidate and why they want to be a part of it. Mention specific projects, initiatives, or values of the company.
Skills and Experience: Emphasize the candidate’s relevant skills and past work experiences, making it clear how they benefit the company.
Closing: End with a confident call to action, expressing eagerness for the opportunity to discuss further.
Thank You: Thank the reader for considering the application.
Sincerely: Sign off with the candidate’s name.
After following this structure, ensure the cover letter meets these criteria:

Demonstrates the candidate’s personality and passion for the role.
Shows effort in researching the company and role.
Addresses any gaps in the candidate’s career history positively.
Mentions the company name and specific details about the role.
Clearly explains why the candidate is the perfect fit for the role.
Uses professional yet engaging language.
Aligns the candidate’s achievements with the company’s goals and values.

Additional Instructions:

Put heavy emphasis on the candidate’s relevant skills and how they benefit the company.
If there are key skills mentioned in the job description that the candidate does not possess, briefly acknowledge them and express eagerness to learn or highlight transferable skills.
Ensure the cover letter reflects the candidate’s unique voice and personality.
Tips for Each Section:

Opening: Start with a personal touch or a notable achievement. For example, “As a software engineer with a passion for machine learning, I was thrilled to see your job posting for a Machine Learning Engineer.”
Why I’m the Perfect Candidate: Use numbers to show impact. For example, “In my previous role, I led a team that increased sales by 20% through the implementation of a new CRM system.”
Company Interest: Reference specific company initiatives. For example, “I am particularly excited about your company’s commitment to sustainability, as evidenced by your recent initiative to reduce carbon emissions.”
Addressing Career Gaps: Frame gaps positively. For example, “During my time away from the workforce, I took the opportunity to develop my skills in [relevant area] through [coursework, volunteering, etc.].”
Additional Note:

Ensure the cover letter directly references specific skills and experiences from the resume that align with the job description. Highlight how these make the candidate a strong fit for the role.

Your cover letter is your written sales pitch. You've got a resume that summarizes everything. Now you have to write out a more complete, professional description of you and what you can offer a given company. 
Here's a sample cover letter to get you started:

I hope your day is going well! My name is _________, and I'm a _________ at _________. I am very interested in working for _________ next _________. Your commitment to _________ and _________ that I saw on the website inspired me! The products you build and the values you stand for make _________ seem like an ideal workplace for me.

Please let me know if there's anything else you need from me. I look forward to hearing from you! I can be reached at _________ and _________

Best regards,
__________

Now, remember, this is just a sample. You can write a cover letter in any format you'd like. But, you should be sure to include the following:

Who - Who you are. Easy enough.
Where - Where you're coming from.
Why - Why you're interested in this company, and show that you researched them.
What - What you can bring to the table.
When - When you're available to start, and when they can contact you.
How - How they can reach you.

If the candidate has no proper relevent experience, add huge emphasis on needing an opportunity to start their career
