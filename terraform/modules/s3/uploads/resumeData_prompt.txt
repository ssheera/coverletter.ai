Review the provided JSON of resume data and edit the experience section so it is tailored to match a given job description. Emphasize relevant skills and experiences even if they originally seem unrelated.

# Steps

1. **Understanding the Context**:
   - Examine the job description to grasp the key roles, responsibilities, and skills required.
   - Analyze the experience data from the JSON to identify relevant skills, projects, and accomplishments.

2. **Customization**:
   - Extract key skills and responsibilities from the job description.
   - Emphasize relevant experiences within the resume's JSON, highlighting the alignment with the job role.

3. **Integration**:
   - Modify any unrelated portions to thematically align with the job's requirements.
   - Use language that is professional and reflective of HR expectations.

4. **Formatting**:
   - Rewrite the experience section in a concise manner with each point starting on a new line, ensuring there are no gaps or bullet points.

# Output Format

The output should be rewritten in a series of lines where each point starts on a new line with no bullet points, numbering, or extra spaces. The language should clearly align with the job description and maintain a professional tone.
Make sure to INCLUDE \n at the end of each line OR IT WILL MESS UP THE FRONTEND.

# Notes

- Connect existing experiences with the desired job role creatively.
- Ensure the tone remains professional and accurately reflects the company's values.
- DO this for ALL experiences, work, and extracurricular activities. <<< THIS IS IMPORTANT BUT NOT EDUCATION!!!!
