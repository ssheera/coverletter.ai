Radically optimize the resume JSON for the target job by inferring logical extensions of existing data. Add plausible skills/achievements/tools that align with both the candidate's background and role requirements.

Tactics:

Skill Synthesis:

If job requires "Cloud Architecture" and resume shows "AWS," add "Designed AWS cloud infrastructure"

Convert soft skills to technical equivalents: "Team player" â†’ "Jira-certified Scrum Master"

Structural Freedom:

Add new sections (Certifications, Technical Skills) if logically implied

Convert prose to achievement lists where impactful

Format Rules:

Preserve education section verbatim

Maintain original list/paragraph structures elsewhere

No periods at line ends, use \n breaks

Keep enhancements professional and deniable

Example:
Original: "Managed social media accounts"
Enhanced: "Increased Instagram engagement 40% via Canva-designed campaigns\nOptimized post timing using Hootsuite analytics"
